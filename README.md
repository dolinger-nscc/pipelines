# Pycaret 3 Pipelines to Scikit-Learn Pipelines  
This project will illustrate using [Pycaret 3](https://pycaret.org/) to develop a predictive model pipeline and then recreate with scikit-learn. The primary modules of focus will be classification, regression, and clustering.  

## Plan:
The intent of the project is to create a methodology for incorporating an AutoML technology, in this case Pycaret 3, into a training vehicle for "Citizen Data Scientists".

## Data:
Data used within the examples will include:
* dat1
* dat2
* dat3
