# Pycaret 3 Pipelines to Scikit-Learn Pipelines  
This project will illustrate using [Pycaret 3](https://pycaret.org/) to develop a predictive model pipline and then recreate with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). The primary modules of focus will be classification, regression, and clustering.  

## Plan:
The intent of the project is to create a methodoligy for incorporting an AutoML technology, in this case Pycaret 3, into a training vehicle for "Citizen Data Scientists". 

## Data:
