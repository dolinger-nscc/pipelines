# Pycaret 3 Pipelines to Scikit-Learn Pipelines  
This project will illustrate using [Pycaret 3](https://pycaret.org/) to develop a predictive model pipeline and then recreate with scikit-learn. The primary modules of focus will be classification, regression, and clustering. For this particular project, the scope will be on a classification pipeline build using the AutoML features of Pycaret 3. The classification pipeline will be a simple predictive model using the [Palmer Penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) dataset. 

## Plan:
The intent of the project is to demonstrate a methodology for incorporating an AutoML technology, in this case Pycaret 3, into a training vehicle for "Citizen Data Scientists". The intent of this project is to teach the statistical concepts required in creating a predictive model using Pycaret, then taking the knowledge gained in creating the pipeline and recreating in a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) using Python, Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-Learn.

## Data:
Data used within the examples will include:
* the Palmer Penguins dataset as sourced from Allison Horst's GitHub repository.

## .ipynb
The notebook can be viewed and downloaded in [Jupyter Notebook Viewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/dolinger-nscc/pipelines/blob/main/Notebooks/Classification_Penguins.ipynb).
